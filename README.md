# Point-FCW: a TDA machine learning pipeline for point cloud classification
Point-FCW: transposed-FCW Graph Representation for Point Cloud Classification using TDA

Point-FCW is a machine learning pipeline for point cloud classification using **transposed fully connected and weighted (t-FCW)** graph representation integrated with topological data analysis (TDA). Our lightweight framework efficiently extracts features from 3D point clouds, offering a robust and complementary approach to state-of-the-art models.

## üî• Key Features
- **t-FCW Graph Representation**: A highly efficient and scalable transformation for point clouds, reducing computational complexity.
- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Feature extraction via persistence diagrams, persistence landscapes, Betti curves, and more.
- **Model Integration**: Enhance performance by plugging Point-FCW into existing networks like Point-NN or PointMLP.
