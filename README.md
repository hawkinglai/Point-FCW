Point-FCW is an open-source project for point cloud classification using **transposed fully connected and weighted (t-FCW)** graph representation integrated with topological data analysis (TDA). Our lightweight framework efficiently extracts features from 3D point clouds, offering a robust and complementary approach to state-of-the-art models.

## üî• Key Features
- **t-FCW Graph Representation**: A highly efficient and scalable transformation for point clouds, reducing computational complexity.
- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Feature extraction via persistence diagrams, persistence landscapes, Betti curves, and more.
- **Model Integration**: Enhance performance by plugging Point-FCW into existing networks like Point-NN or PointMLP.
- **High Efficiency**: Handles large point cloud volumes with stable computational complexity.
- **Visualization**: Enables matching score landscapes for classification progress observation.

## üìñ How It Works

1. **t-FCW Graph Construction**: 
   - Transforms point cloud into a transposed fully connected and weighted graph.
   - Efficiently extracts meaningful patterns while reducing computational demands.
   - See pseudocode implementation [here](docs/t-FCW.md).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Applies TDA via vectorization techniques: persistence entropy, landscapes, Betti curves, etc.
   - Ensures lightweight yet effective feature representation.

3. **Model Integration**:
   - Use Point-FCW as a standalone classifier or integrate it with neural networks for enhanced performance.

## üìÇ Usage

### Example Workflow

```python
from point_fcw import PointFCW

# Load and preprocess point cloud data
point_cloud = load_point_cloud('example.pcd')

# Create t-FCW graph representation
graph = PointFCW.to_tfcw(point_cloud)

# Extract features using TDA
features = PointFCW.extract_tda_features(graph)

# Classify using non-parametric head
label = PointFCW.classify(features)
```
